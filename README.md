### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Viktor Mileski, a passionate 19-year-old currently immersing myself in the programming world at Qinshift Academy. 
My technology journey has led me to delve deep into languages like C# (.NET) and Javascript, 
while also mastering the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). With a hunger for 
knowledge and a drive to excel, I am dedicated to honing my skills and contributing meaningfully 
to the ever-evolving landscape of software development.
